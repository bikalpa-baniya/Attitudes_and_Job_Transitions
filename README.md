# Attitudes_and_Job_Transitions

(Ongoing) How does one's attitude affect job transitions from employment or unemployment? Gregory, Menzio, and Wiczer (2021) create three clusters of individuals based on these transitions. Alpha cluster have low transition rates, Beta clusters have higher transition rate and Gamma have the highest rate. These codes try to recreate these clusters from NLS79 and observe the effect of attitudes on how often one might move from unemployment to employment or vice versa.
